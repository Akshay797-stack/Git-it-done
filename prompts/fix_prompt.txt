Please analyze the issue and the codebase.
You must fix the issue by rewriting the ENTIRE content of the file(s) that need changes.
Do not generate a diff. Generate the FULL FILE content.

IMPORTANT: Output the FULL CONTENT of the modified file(s).
IMPORTANT: Do not output files that have not changed.
IMPORTANT: If you are fixing multiple issues, combine them into the final file content. Do not output the same file multiple times.
Output format:
For each changed file, output:
File: <path/to/file>
```<language>
<full_content_of_file>
```

Example:
File: src/index.js
```javascript
const a = 1;
// ... full content ...
```
